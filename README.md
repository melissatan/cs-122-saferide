# cs-122-saferide

## uchicago cs122 project (winter 2010) - saferide shuttle operator, pair programming project by Jerry Lo and Melissa Tan

(Putting this up mainly just in case my local disk ever dies.)

This is based on the University of Chicago's Saferide system of point-to-point night shuttles, 
which was (and perhaps still is) coordinated manually by human operators.

The program does the same job. It simulates a shuttle coordinator who receives requests for shuttle pick-ups 
and drop-offs, and assigns each requester to the best-suited van operating at that time. 
It allows comparison of different van-passenger scheduling algorithms. 

To run, run Operator.java.

Input: a map formatted in a certain way (map of Hyde Park included as demo). 

Shuttle requests are randomly generated. Best van is determined based on factors such as van location and van passengers. 

Output: map depicting each pick-up and drop-off, plus each van's movements. 

Findings (see Report.ppt): best algorithm varied depending on map size and unreachable nodes in the map 
(due to road blockages, dead-ends, etc).
